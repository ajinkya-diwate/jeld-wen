1. Development (Dev) Environment:
   - Create a new feature branch for this specific feature named `feature/US-000***â€™ and commit the changes made to BookCreationAPI class and the BookCreationAPITest test class to this branch
   - Push the changes made in your feature branch to your Git repository once the 75+( Ideally 90%) code coverage is achieved in the Dev Org run.


2. Integration Environment:
   - CI/CD pipeline should be configured to automatically trigger deployment whenever changes are pushed from the feature branch to Integration Org Branch using a Pull Request.
   - Deploy the changes from your feature branch to the Integration environment using your CI/CD pipeline .
   - Test the feature's integration with other components.
   - Testing team should Conduct testing specific to the new feature as well as E2E business flows, ensuring that it meets the requested functional requirements.


3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment:
   - If the integration tests are successful, create a deployment package that includes the changes from the feature branch.
   - Deploy the package to the UAT environment through your CI/CD pipeline.
   - Conduct UAT testing specific to the new feature, ensuring that it meets the desired functionality and user requirements.



4. Staging Environment:
   - Similar to UAT, deploy the feature changes to the Staging environment also Run all Test classes to ensure seamless delivery to production.
   - Test the feature's behaviour within the broader context of the application and perform Regression Testing specifically on Existing Data as well as Newly created Data.
   - Run comprehensive end-to-end tests in the Staging environment to ensure that the feature integrates seamlessly with the existing components.

5. Production Environment:
   - After successful testing in Staging, create a deployment package for Production that includes the feature changes.
   - Deploy the package to the Production environment through your CI/CD pipeline.
    - Run High Level Component Checks in the Production environment to confirm that the new components related to feature are deployed as expected and has not negatively impacted existing components.

6. Rollback Plan:
    - In case of critical issues, you can revert the changes by removing the feature branch or applying hotfixes to the `dev` branch.
